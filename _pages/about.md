This project is built upon the collaboration between the Shanghai Research Institute for Intelligent Autonomous Systems and GAITECH ROBOTICS in research and development. It revolves around the RIAODO intelligent platform and associated components such as smart lamp posts, aiming to create a distributed air pollution monitoring system. The system will deploy and establish a minute-level basic wind field model. It will incorporate functions such as monitoring data fitting within the pollution range, calculation of pollution diffusion centers, GIS visualization platform for outputting three-dimensional positions of pollution sources, microgram-level precise monitoring, wide-scale deployment with coordinated operation, and long-distance information flow interaction capabilities.
